# PSG Script. Source: Carnegie Mellon University

Summary:
PSG helps programmers develop module-level programs. It is a problem-oriented guide, so I start by stating the problem and creating an issue in Gitlab. Then I need to plan how to implement the functionality by conceptual design and size estimation. Then I can start developing. After development, I can begin the acceptance Test and record all the defects throughout this process. Finally, I can summarize, evaluate my performance, and write anything notable. 

Strength:
* The script proposes a well-organized process to develop module-level programs. 
* The estimation process is vital to people like me who need time management.

Weakness: 
* It provides little insight into implementing a complex program because it only focuses on individual work.


#George Dinwiddie, Are We There Yet? Agile Situational Awareness Using Estimation Source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyltKNFkZk8

Summary:
The lecturer first asks listeners to estimate the total time cost for a trip. Breaking down the total into many smaller steps helps people get ready. The estimate also helps people keep track of how their plan is going. However, people may not consider accidents, uncertainties, or legacy problems, so always allow contingency buffer time when planning. Refrain from confusing estimates and plans because estimates only inform plans and make assumptions measurable. They are not plans, so we can adjust if the reality differs from our assumptions.

Strength:
* The trip example is impressive. It stresses the time management component in software engineering. Since a trip simple like that can be so unpredictable, software development can be even more unexpected. 
* He pointed out several practical rules to follow. Always consider accidents. Adjust the plan when the reality differs from estimations.

Weakness:
* The time may be exponentially larger for a complex and large project than for a small or medium project. The estimation may become completely useless and only cause over-optimism. I would say start as soon as possible in that situation. We don't really need an estimation in that situation.
