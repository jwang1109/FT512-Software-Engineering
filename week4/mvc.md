Blueprint is the view component of the MVC pattern. Flask provided Blueprint as the user Interface. It works closely with Browser and Server. The database is the Model component. The model relates to the Blueprint, like the blog contents, titles, and user ID, password. They are all stored in the database, and the Flask can access them. For the controller component, I believe Flask is the controller. It provides WSGI to parse HTTP requests and responses and manages the registration, configuration, and calls of the model and the view component. Those three components work perfectly to serve as a web architecture.
