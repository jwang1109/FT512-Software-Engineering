# FT512-SoftwareEngineering

This repository showcases my work and dedication to the FT512-SoftwareEngineering course during my second semester at Duke. I am proud to have achieved an A+ in this course.

Through this course, I honed my programming skills in Python and C++. One of the highlights is `bigbucks`, which was the most complex team project in this course. It is a Python Flask-based web project, designed to function as a trading system, offering a range of impressive features. 

## Warning to Current Students:

If you are a student currently enrolled in the FT510 programming course, **please refrain from viewing or copying any of the solutions within this repository**. Doing so might lead to violations of academic integrity. Always strive to complete your assignments on your own and seek guidance from your instructor if needed.

## Many thanks to my teammates in the Bigbucks project: Yuru Chen, Allen Liu, Evie Zheng
I am the team leader and the architect in this project. Other assignments are individual ones.
