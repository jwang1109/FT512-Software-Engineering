For refactoring, I didn't notice that many functions are actually wrapper functions until last. Thus I only passed the test a few times but had to move on.

For charting, I struggle to format a string because I use the symbol '', but what the JavaScript need is ``. I need to be more careful next time.

For updating flaskr, I struggling to let the script know the locations of files it will use. The Flaskr has a repository called static to store those static files. I should have been awared of that but the flask is complex for beginner. I need more time to learn and practice it.
