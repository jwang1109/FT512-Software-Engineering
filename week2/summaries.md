Robertson, Suzanne, and James Robertson author. Mastering the Requirements Process: Getting Requirements Right. Addison-Wesley, Boston, Massachusetts, 2012.

Keywords: requirements, agile development,functional requirements, nonfunctional requirements, constraints, product, requirements gathering.

Summary: The authors mainly introduce the basics of requirements. Firstly, they discuss requirements that should exist in a product's whole life cycle. We should notice the system modeling overlaps some of the requirements gatherings, and we don't need to complete the who requirement specification before we start. Then he introduced agile development, a method emphasizing interactions over process, working software over documentation, etc. However, it's a method of value changing than structuring. The authors argue a wrong view that believes there is no conflict between agile development and requirements,	so people should try to balance them according to their agility ratings.
 The second half of the article mainly introduces what functional and nonfunctional requirements and	constraints and "business requirements are." 

Strength:
1. Clear logic	and graph that shows how elements of requirements are organized.
2. "Rabbit, horse, elephant." The agility ratings suggested by	the authors can	e useful when balancing agile development and proper structural	process	or documentation.
3. Concrete examples are raised	to help me understand concepts.	Eg. For constraints, the authors write, "The product must be available at the beginning of the new tax year."
4. Conciseness and precise delivery.	Often start a paragraph with a definition or the summary of that paragraph.

Weaknesses:
1. For agile development, they need to explain better. They don't include a real-world example but only discuss on principle level, so I can only imagine.

Summary:
The author introduces the CRC card as an effective way to teach Object-oriented programming. Whether a novice or experienced programmer, they will be more readily identify the class after creating CRC cards. He also discussed his experiment and emphasized that physical interaction is the key, and it has the potential to be integrated into a current development system.

Keywords: CRC card, OOP, teaching, program design

Strength:
The paper is based on experiments and hands-on experience, which is practical.
CRC cards are well-explained. Discussion is provided on class, responsibility, and collaborators.

Weakness:
1. The lack of comparison makes the cause-effect questionable. Time could possibly have some effects on it. In one of those experiments, people spent an hour creating CRC cards and getting more familiar with the class. The article needs a discussion on time spent on it. Also, the author emphasizes that physical interaction is essential, but he doesn't compare it with an electronic CRC card, which might just have the same effectiveness.
2. Since his finding based on experiments, the number of samples is essential. While what I read were only a few examples. Thus, the author reached a conclusion too unconsciously.
3. An improvement in identifying a class on a card might not be helpful when the programmer is actually coding it.
4. Toy problems in an experiment can be irrelevant. Programmers may still feel lost when encountering a huge project involving hundreds of classes.


HTML Fundamentals,https://info340.github.io/html-fundamentals.html

HTML files contain the content of a web page. It starts the element with an opening tag <xxx> and ends with a closing tag <\xx>. However, an image element has no textual content, so it is an empty element that doesn't require a closing tag. Also worth attention, there are block elements on a new line and inline elements with no line break after them. In addition to the <body> element, we also have the <head> section, where <title> is to specify the title of a webpage and <meta> is to include more information such as encoding information, author, and description. This article also provided example elements. A start tag of an element contains attributes, just like attributes in a class. I can use hyperlinks and images as attributes. I can also give them an ID and nest them. 
Finally, for a web page structure to be complete, it's also an exemplary implementation to explicitly declare the document type (format and syntax your document is using).

Strength:
1. Explained HTMl concisely and clearly.
2. The article provides abundant examples.

Weakness:
3. Only toy designs are included. It might be better to lead readers to read through a real-world example.



CSS Fundamentals,https://info340.github.io/css.html

CSS(Cascading Style Sheets) defines a set of formatting rules. A good practice for using CSS is to separate the design of a website(CSS) from its semantics(HTML). A CSS rule looks like selector{formatting properties;} A semi-column is necessary. I need to be careful because, without the semi-colon, the style I want may fail silently. CSS is called cascade because multiple rules can apply to the same element. CSS also applies inherited properties, and specificity is the last rule on the pages that comes into effect. Note that some Selector Specificity may violate the "last win" rule.

Strength: 
1. Clearly explained terminology.
2. Abundant Examples
3. Zen Garden has amazing visual effect

Weakness:
1. No advanced topics are included.

JavaScript Fundamentals,https://info340.github.io/javascript.html

JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted language that allows browsers to execute an algorithm. A developer could use it to print text and error messages. I could include JavaScript directly in HTML or use it on the command line. Though the language tries to be "helpful" and assumes programmers will make some mistakes, the best practice is to execute it in strict mode. Unlike C, and C++, JavaScript is dynamically typed, but you should write a let statement. Then the article introduces some basic data types like Numbers, boolean, arrays, and objects. Also, JavaScript has control structures and functions just like any programming language.

Strength:
1. Clearly introduced fundamentals of JavaScript

Weakness:
1. After reading this, I still feel unconfident in writing JavaScript for the assignment. Most of the examples are created without any connection to a webpage. They are just isolated examples.
